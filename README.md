# Geo-Mapping-Data (Choropleth maps)
Data Vsualization Final Project- IBM Coursera
In this assignment we were asked to demonstrate the data visualization skills learned by completing the course. We were required to generate two visualization plots. The first one will be a plot to summarize the results of a survey that was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics. The second plot is a Choropleth map of the crime crate in San Francisco.
